    "## Task 1: Electronic Dice for Classroom Games\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "A primary school teacher, Ms. Harper, wants to engage her students in math lessons by introducing games that use dice rolls. However, traditional dice often get lost or cause classroom disruptions. To resolve this, she wants a simple, interactive, visual electronic dice that students can operate by pressing a button. When pressed, the dice should randomly display one of six numbers by illuminating the corresponding LED (1-6) and simultaneously print the dice result clearly on a connected console. This helps her keep track of each roll and facilitates a way for students to verify the dice result easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Requirements\n",
    "##### 1.\tMicrocontroller Setup:\n",
    "Use a microcontroller that supports GPIO pins, such as ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico,  with MicroPython support.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Connect a push button to initiate the dice roll process.\n",
    "##### 2.\tLED Display:\n",
    "Connect six LEDs to the microcontroller, each representing a specific dice number (1-6): \n",
    "    \n",
    "LED 1 (1)\n",
    "    \n",

    "LED 5 (5)\n",
    "    \n",
    "LED 6 (6)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The LED corresponding to the rolled number should light up while others remain off.\n",
    "##### 3.\tAudio Feedback:\n",
    "Use a passive buzzer to generate a dice-rolling sound.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The sound should simulate a rolling effect using different frequencies before displaying the final result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The buzzer should be controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to generate sound properly.\n",
    "##### 4.\tButton Handling:\n",
    "Implement a push-button interface to trigger the dice roll.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Include a debounce mechanism to prevent multiple activations from a single press.\n",
    "##### 5.\tRandomisation:\n",
    "Use a random number generator to ensure fair and unpredictable dice rolls.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Display the result both via serial output and LED indicators.\n",
    "##### 6.\tLoop Execution:\n",
    "Continuously listen for button presses and execute the dice roll logic accordingly\n",
    "\n",

    "6. Passive Buzzer\n",

    "### Expected Outcome\n",
    "Upon pressing the button, a rolling sound plays, and a random dice number (1-6) is generated. Based on the dice roll, the corresponding LED lights up, and the dice result is displayed on the serial monitor.\n",
    "\n",
