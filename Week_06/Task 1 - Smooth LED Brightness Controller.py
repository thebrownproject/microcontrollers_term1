# 1. Connect an LED to the appropriate GPIO on the Raspberry Pi Pico 
# 2. Connect a potentiometer to the appropriate GPIO(ADC)
# 3. Use ADC to read the Analog value from the potentiometer.
# 4. Use PWM to control the LEDâ€™s brightness based on the potentiometer input.
# 5. Add a short delay in the loop to smooth the brightness transition.
